This file contains notes, terminalogy and new things I learned for this project and for future reference 


Webpack-This is an openSource Javascript website bundler. Made primarily for javascript, but it can transform front end assets such as HTML,CSS and images if the corresponding loaders are included 
Basically it takes all your code and turns it into one giant js file for effiecny so our code can run

Babel-open source js transcompiler that turns new js code into older versions so everything stays compatible 

component- pieces of code that can be reused over and over again, must return a jsx element to be a component 

    example of a component:
    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
    root.render(
    
    <React.StrictMode> 
        {/*Strictmode is for better warnings than we would typically would get but it is not neccessary*/}
        {/*while in strictmode, we create out app*/}
        {/*This is an example of a component*/}
        <App /> 
    </React.StrictMode>
    );

    not an example of a component:
    function foo(){
        return "hi"; // does not return a jsx element
    }
